## Abstract
This project is a dataset analysis of the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), available to the public as JSON files. We will apply two techniques seen in the course using Apache Spark, Dask or scikit-learn. The results will be discussed and interpreted.

The Yelp dataset is a subset of businesses, reviews and user data, written on the yelp review website, designed to be used for personal or educational purposes. There are multiple ways of using the Yelp dataset, including predicting restaurant [closure](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-yelp-data-to-predict-restaurant-closure-8aafa4f72ad6), popularity, etc. based on various factors such as restaurant density, review count, rating, and price relative to surrounding restaurants. Additionally, the yelp dataset provides user information, reviews or tips users left to businesses which can be used to study a pattern between users and pictures of the food, drinks, menu or restaurant which can be used for image classification.
