## Abstract
This project is a dataset analysis of the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), available to the public as JSON files. We will apply two techniques seen in the course using Apache Spark, Dask or scikit-learn. The results will be discussed and interpreted.

There are multiple ways of using the Yelp dataset, including predicting restaurant [closure](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-yelp-data-to-predict-restaurant-closure-8aafa4f72ad6), popularity, etc. based on various factors such as restaurant density, review count, rating, and price relative to surrounding restaurants.
